# aaa-game

A typed safe plugin for [omegga](https://github.com/brickadia-community/omegga).

This is an auto-generated README file. Please change it before publishing your plugin!

Be sure to edit the script in `setup.sh` to configure your plugin on install, or
remove it entirely if it is unnecessary.

## Install

`omegga install gh:snepderg/aaa-game`

_TODO: more steps...?_

## Usage

* Command: `/aaa <str>`: Interact with the game. The script will prompt you with the previous phrase. Your goal is to increment the phrase alphabetically (don't forget to carry!)
